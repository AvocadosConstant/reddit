# Reddit API Experiments

Playing around with the PRAW API.


## Saved Posts Organizer

 1. Go to your [reddit preferences](https://www.reddit.com/prefs/apps/) and 'create another app' at the bottom of the page.

 2. Select the script radio button and fill in any name and redirect uri, then create the app.

 3. Rename the config.EDIT file to config, and fill in your client-id, client-secret, user agent (can be whatever), and reddit login credentials.

 4. Make sure that the dependencies are installed, then run `python3 script.py`.

 5. Open output/index.html in your browser to check out your saved reddit posts.
